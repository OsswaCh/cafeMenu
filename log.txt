HTML FORMATTING
    - You can add style to an element by specifying it in the style element and setting a property for it like this:
        element {
            property: value;
        }

    - For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, you need to add a meta element with a special content attribute.
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    - The div element is used mainly for design layout purposes unlike the other content elements you have used so far. 
    
    - The <article> element is used to represent a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed and reused independently, such as a news article, blog post, or forum post.
    article elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information.

    - The <section> element is a generic container used to group related content together. It is often used to divide a web page into sections or chapters, and each section can have its own heading.

    - You can use an hr element to display a divider between sections of different content.


CSS
    - You can use the id selector to target a specific element with an id attribute. An id selector is defined by placing the hash symbol # directly in front of the element's id value. For example, if an element has the id of cat then you would target that element like this:
        #cat {
        width: 250px;
        }

    comments:
        - Comments in CSS look like this:
            /* comment here */

    - A class selector is defined by a name with a dot directly in front of it, like this:

        .class-name {
        styles
        }
        Change the existing #menu selector into a class selector by replacing #menu with a class named .menu.

    - The p elements are nested in an article element with the class attribute of item. You can style all the p elements nested anywhere in elements with a class named item like this:
        .item p { }

    - You can give your menu some space between the content and the sides with various padding properties.
    - The current width of the menu will always take up 80% of the body element's width. On a very wide screen, the coffee and dessert appear far apart from their prices.
        Add a max-width property to the menu class with a value of 500px to prevent it from growing too wide.

    - You can change the font-family of text, to make it look different from the default font of your browser. Each browser has some common fonts available to it.
        Change all the text in your body, by adding a font-family property with the value sans-serif. This is a fairly common font that is very readable.
    - You can add a fallback value for the font-family by adding another font name separated by a comma. Fallbacks are used in instances where the initial is not found/available.

    - Make the Est. 2020 text italicized by creating an established class selector and giving it the font-style property with the value italic.

    LINK COLORS
    - You change properties of a link when the link has actually been visited by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:visited { propertyName: propertyValue; }.
    - You change properties of a link when the mouse hovers over them by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:hover { propertyName: propertyValue; }.
    - You change properties of a link when the link is actually being clicked by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:active { propertyName: propertyValue; }.

    IMAGES:
    - To make the image behave like heading elements (which are block-level), create an img type selector and use the value block for the display property and use the applicable margin-left and margin-right values to center it horizontally.
